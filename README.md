# 💡 Sentiment Image Detector

A deep learning-based application that analyzes facial expressions from an image and predicts the corresponding sentiment or emotion such as *Happy*, *Sad*, *Angry*, *Surprised*, *Neutral*, etc.  
It supports both image upload and real-time camera input.

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 Detects emotions from static images or webcam feed  
- 🧠 Trained deep learning model (.h5) for accurate sentiment classification  
- 🧹 Image preprocessing (grayscale, resize) for better prediction  
- 🖼️ Supports formats: `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.  
- 🐍 Built with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Pillow

## ✅ How It Works

1. User chooses to upload an image or capture one via webcam  
2. The image is preprocessed (grayscale, resized to 48x48)  
3. The trained model (`model.h5`) predicts the dominant emotion  
4. The result is displayed in the console or GUI
